# Portfolio Website (Old PC Simulation)
The official repository for my portfolio website hosted at [https://andrevanrensburg.co.za](https://andrevanrensburg.co.za:{target="_blank"})

The Portfolio website is a simulation of an old 80's PC (386) booting from a Disk Operating System (WebDos - inspired by MS-Dos) and a Graphic User Interface (Webdows 9.5 - inspired by Windows 95)

The website is built using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript and even though the repository is public, this is a work in progress, and has upcoming versions in React, VueJS and Angular which you will be able to switch to from the task tray.

*Inspiration is drawn from old Microsoft software systems. All product names, logos, and brands are and remain the property of their respective owners. All company, product and service names used in this project are for entertainment and educational purposes only.*
