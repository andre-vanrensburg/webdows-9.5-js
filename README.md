# Webdows 9.5 (Old PC Simulation) - JS Version

The official repository for my portfolio website hosted at [https://andrevanrensburg.co.za](https://andrevanrensburg.co.za:{target="_blank"})

Webdows 9.5 is a simulation of an old 80's PC (386) booting from a Disk Operating System (WebDos - inspired by MS-Dos) and a Graphic User Interface (Webdows 9.5 - inspired by Windows 95)

The website is built using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript and even though the repository is public, this is a work in progress, and has upcoming versions in React, VueJS, Angular and Svelte which you will be able to switch to from the task tray or by rebooting.
